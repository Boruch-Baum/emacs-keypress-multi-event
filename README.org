* keypress-multi-event

This package for emacs provides a method to define multiple functions
to be performed for the same keypress. You can use this as a
convenience feature to toggle among several functions. It was
originally written as the back-end for package `[[https://github.com/Boruch-Baum/emacs-home-end][home-end]]', allowing
those two keys to smartly cycle between moving POINT to the
beginning/end of a line, the beginning/end of the window, the
beginning/end of the buffer, and back to POINT.

Create a function which calls `keypress-multi-event' with a list
of the functions to be associated with the keypress, and bind
that keypress to that function. By default, subsequent
keypresses cycle through the list, but you can change that
behavior by optionally adding an index into the list as a second
argument, or you could also directly manipulate the underlying
buffer-local variable `keypress-multi-event--state'. Both
methods are illustrated in package `[[https://github.com/Boruch-Baum/emacs-home-end][home-end]]'.
